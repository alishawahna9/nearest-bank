🏦 Nearest Bank Finder
📘 Overview

This project was developed for educational purposes only as part of my software engineering learning journey.
It demonstrates the use of React, Google Maps API, and geolocation services to find and display nearby banks based on the user’s current or simulated location.

✨ Features

🌍 Live Geolocation – Detects the user’s real location (or a custom one for demo purposes).

🗺️ Interactive Google Map – Displays all nearby banks dynamically with markers.

💡 Automatic Dark Mode – The map and interface automatically switch between day and night mode depending on system settings or user preference.

🧭 “Find Me” Button – Centers the map on the user’s (or chosen) location and refreshes nearby results.

🏦 Nearest Bank Detection – Highlights and centers the closest bank to the current location.

📱 Responsive Design – Works smoothly across desktop and mobile screens.
